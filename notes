To do:
implementation side:
- TF framework, asap
- additional generator layer control
- additional num_discriminator_layer variable (they don't have to be the same for sure)
- the mix ratio of noise and img_prev(?, may need hard tuning, put it in additional plan)
- ..

augmentation side:
- some ~60s*60s image (cadio one on the way) by 10th
- ImageNet (normal portfolio) not sure about time now
- Human Face (would the result make sense?) by 10th
- Very large-scale dataset? check time efficiency on GCP


Variable to be tuned:
 - alpha,
 - scale coefficient is checked but not sure
